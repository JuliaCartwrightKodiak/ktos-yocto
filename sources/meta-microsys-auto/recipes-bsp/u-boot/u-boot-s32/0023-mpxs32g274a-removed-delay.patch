Organization: MicroSys Electronics GmbH

Removed delay because PMIC initialization happens now during
ATF-boot.

-     * the I2C-bus too early the I2C-controller hardware is not ready.
-     * As a consequence the access hangs and the watchdog is never stopped.
-     * This is specially the case when booting from QSPI. Booting from SD-card needs
-     * a little bit longer and the problem remains undiscovered.
